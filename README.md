# Hospital Patient Record & Severity Management System

## Project Description

This project is a console-based Hospital Patient Management System developed using the C programming language.
It helps store and manage patient details, treatment information, and severity levels in a structured manner using file handling.

The system also provides severity-based filtering to view patients who require different levels of medical attention.
